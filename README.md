World Weather Analysis

## Objective 
After a succesful pilot of the World Weather app we have received feedback from the testers. They would like a few features added to the app. Below is the new feature request:

* A weather description to the pop-up markers for customers so that they know what the weather is as they are traveling
* A notation in the search criteria to indicate if it is raining or snowing for customers who are making travel decisions in real-time
* A map that shows the directions for customersâ€™ travel itinerary

## Analysis
### Fare Analysis by City Type and Driver Count

Analysis of fares by city type and driver count shows a correlation between city type and average fare. Urban cities have more rides and more drivers, this combination tends to drive down the average fare in urban cities by comparison to suburban and rural cities. Data suggest that areas with less drivers and rides yield a higher average fare and an average fare per driver. While the data suggest this could be due to a longer average distance per ride, further analysis is needed to prove this conclusion. 

### Total Fares by City Type Plot

The plot of total fares by city type over time shows that urban cities are consitently more profitable for the company despite having a lower average fare per driver and per ride. Week over week urban cities generate more than double total fares than suburban cities and more than ten times total fares for rural cities. Urban and suburban cities appear to have a more consistent total fares pattern than urban cities. less volatility in total fares could be a factor of lower demand and fewer drivers. Future analysis should explore ride patterns in suburban and rural areas in comparison to urban cities.
